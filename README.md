# Nim-Game

**Nim-Game** is a Java written, coomand-line version of the game Nim. An 
example and the rules of the game can be seen at the 
[arhcimedes-lab](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/game_nim/nim.html).

The game was written in three stages as a requirement for a university subject 
on Java, with each stage building on the last.
The specifications each of the three projects can be found in their respective 
directories.
